## Overview:

Utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I was able to create a fun game of Tic-Tac-Toe featuring two fan favorite's, Mario and Luigi!

## Setup

1. Clone this repo down to your local machine
2. In the terminal, type `cd Tic-Tac-Toe` to switch into the root directory
3. From there, type `open index.html` to load the game in your browser and begin playing!

## Game Instructions

1. Declare one person "Player 1" or "Luigi" and another person "Player 2" or "Mario"
2. "Player 1" will click any empty square on the board to begin
3. "Player 2" will then select any remaining empty square to make their move
4. Both players will continue taking turns placing their tokens in empty spaces until a win is declared === three of a player's tokens are in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
5. When a game is won, the winning player's scoreboard will increase by one and the game will restart after a few seconds. Player two will then begin the next game
6. If neither player wins, a `tie` will be declared, neither of the player's scores will increase and the game will restart

# ENJOY!
