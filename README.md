# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview:
 Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game with a goal of getting three X's or O's in a row in order to win. Utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I was able to create a fun game featuring two fan favorite's, Mario and Luigi.

## Setup
1. Fork and clone this repo to your local machine
2. Type "cd Tic-Tac-Toe" to switch into the root directory
3. From there, type "open index.html" to load the game webpage and begin playing!

## Game Instructions
1. Declare one person "Player 1" or "Luigi" and another person "Player 2" or "Mario"
2. "Player 1" will click a square on the board, marking their first move
3. "Player 2" will then click on any of the unselected squares to initiate their first move
4. Both players should attempt to get three of their characters in a row in order to win
5. Once a player wins, the game will automatically reset for players to begin again!
